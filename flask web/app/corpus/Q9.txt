May I extend my OPT work eligibility beyond 12-months?
In two instances, it may be possible to extend the period of OPT, based on a new OPT regulation published on April 8th, 2008.
In the first case, the student must be hold a STEM degree (science, technology, engineering or math), be hired by an employer signed up for the government program "E-Verify", and will have to apply for the 17-month extension on Form I-765 with fee.
