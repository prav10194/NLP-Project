Can I be unemployed while approved for OPT, and still legally remain in the U.S.? The new regulations published on April 8th, 2008, limit periods of unemployment during post-completion OPT. F-1 status is now dependent upon employment, within the following parameters: Students may not accrue an aggregate of more than 90 days of unemployment during any post-completion OPT carried out under the initial 12-month post-completion OPT authorization. Students granted a 17-month OPT extension may not accrue an aggregate of more than 120 days of unemployment.
