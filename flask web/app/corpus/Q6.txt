What does the immigration service consider "completion of studies?"
Completion of studies is the actual date that you complete all requirements for a program of study (i.e. the date of your final exams, or submission of your thesis or dissertation).Â "Completion of studies" is NOT automatically considered to be the date of graduation ceremonies.
