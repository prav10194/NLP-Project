Can I register for graduate examination credit while on OPT? You may be eligible if you are past the academic program end date on your I-20 and you already applied for post-completion OPT. Before registering, please contact an international student adviser. If you have not passed the program end date on your I-20 and are applying for pre-completion OPT, you must enroll in research credit until you reach your program end date.
