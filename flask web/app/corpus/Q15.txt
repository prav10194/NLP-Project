May I travel outside the U.S. before I receive the employment card for OPT, and also after I receive the card?
The answer to this question depends very much on a variety factors specific to what kind of OPT application, and each person's own unique situation. While on OPT you are still considered to be in F-1 (student) immigration status, even if you have completed your studies and have since graduated.
