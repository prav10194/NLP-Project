Can I take classes during OPT? If you have only research left and you already applied for post-completion OPT, you can continue to register until you finish the research requirements. You are subject to the 90-day unemployment rule, even if you are still registered. Beginning a new course of study will automatically cancel your OPT authorization. The International Center does not recommend taking a class that may later be used to satisfy new degree program requirements.
