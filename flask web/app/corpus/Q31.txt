My EAD says "not valid for re-entry" on it. Does that mean I cannot travel abroad and re-enter on OPT?
It simply means that you must carry other documents to show proof of your eligibility to re-enter the U.S. such as your I-20 and valid F-1 visa stamp. The EAD alone is not enough to re-enter the U.S.
