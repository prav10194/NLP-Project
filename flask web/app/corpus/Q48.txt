What if I cannot find employment? Unemployment is limited to no more than 90 days during the whole 12 months of OPT. You are required to work in your field of study to maintain your status on OPT. What is considered work is flexible - you may be employed, intern, volunteer, etc. As long as you are getting full-time experience related to your degree, your status is maintained.
