Can I change employers while on OPT? Yes, provided the new employment is directly related to your field of study and you work a minimum of 20 hours per week. No special permission is required to change employers.  However, you must update your employer information to Berkeley International Office within 10 days of the change through our online Student SEVIS Update (SSU)(link is external) form.
