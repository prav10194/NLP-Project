Can I go to school while on OPT? Time spent going to school should only be an incidental part of your stay in the U.S. If you decide to go back to school full-time, you must speak to an advisor at BIO about transferring your I-20 to the new institution or updating your I-20 if your degree program is at Berkeley.
