After I have submitted my OPT application, can I change my start date? If your OPT application has not been approved, it may be possible to change the start date. However, there is no guarantee that the request to change your dates will be approved. Please contact an international student adviser immediately if you would like to change your dates. Once an application has been approved, the start date cannot be changed.
