May I cancel my OPT application once I have applied? Yes, you may request that the OPT application be withdrawn and the recommendation in SEVIS be cancelled, but only if you have recently mailed it to the government. Contact your advisor as soon as possible, if you need to cancel the OPT application. Once your OPT application has been adjudicated (approved) by the immigration service, it can not be cancelled or revoked.
